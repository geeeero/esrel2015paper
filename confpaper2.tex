\abstract{In reliability engineering, data about failure events is often scarce.
To arrive at meaningful estimates for the reliability of a system,
it is therfore often necessary to also include expert information in the analysis,
which can be easily done in the Bayesian approach by using an informative prior distribution.

A problem that then can arise is called prior-data conflict:
from the viewpoint of the prior, the observed data seem very surprising,
i.e., the information from data is in conflict with the prior assumptions.
It has been recognised that models based on conjugate priors can be insensitive to prior-data conflict,
in the sense that the spread of the posterior distribution does not increase in case of such a conflict,
thus conveying a false sense of certainty by communicating that we know the reliability of a system quite precisely when in fact we do not.

We present an approach to mitigate this issue, by considering sets of prior distributions,
and making use of the recently introduced survival signature to characterise the system under study.
Our approach can be seen as a robust Bayesian procedure or imprecise probability method
that appropriately reflects surprising data in the posterior survival function or other posterior inferences.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

In reliability engineering, a central task is to describe the reliability of a complex system.
This is usually done by determining the \emph{reliability function} $R(t)$,
in other contexts also known as the \emph{survival function} $S(t)$,
giving the probability that the system has not failed by time $t$:
\begin{align}
R(t) = S(t) = P(T_\text{sys} \geq t)\,,
\end{align}
where $T_\text{sys}$ is the random variable giving the failure time of the system. %
%\footnote{}
Based on the distribution of $T_\text{sys}$, which can also be expressed
in terms of the cumulative distribution function $F(t) = 1 - R(t)$,
the density $p(t)$ or the hazard rate $\lambda(t)$,
decisions about, e.g., scheduling of maintenance work can be made.

Often, there is no failure data for the system itself (e.g., if the system is a prototype),
but some data about failure times exists for the components the system is made of.
Information on the distribution of component failure times $T_i$,
where $i = 1, \ldots, k$ if the system consists of $k$ components,
can then be used to derive the distribution of $T_\text{sys}$.
In this paper we will mostly look at a simple parallel system with one type of components only.
In the last section, we will briefly describe
how the approach can be generalized to arbitrary system structures
with different types of components
using the survival signature \cite{2012:survsign,2014:bayessurvsign}.

We assume a parametric probability distribution for component lifetimes $T_i$.
In the Bayesian approach described here, then

Model for data, here lifetimes: Weibull with fixed shape,
so need to learn about scale parameter $\lambda$.

Prior on $\lambda$: convenient choice inverse Gamma,
to fix prior, need to choose hyperparameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
We use different parametrization $s_0$ and $t_0$, interpretation.

Conjugacy ensures that posterior is inverse Gamma again
with updated parameters $s_n$ and $t_n$,
with simple update rule.

let $s_0$ and $t_0$ vary in rectangular set.
