Built in 1968, this multi-level concrete parking facility has been
subjected to years of moisture and chloride ion attack causing it
to experience corrosion-related deterioration to the point that
its structural integrity was being compromised. Over the years,
moisture and chloride contamination has caused both the embedded
mild steel and paper wrapped "Button-Head" post-tensioning to
experience corrosion-related deterioration, which in turn, has
resulted in the failure of the post-tensioning system.  After
years of monitoring and structural capacity calculations, sections
of the structure were deemed to be no longer able to safely
support the applied loading.  This paper will illustrate the
procedures implemented in the design of the new post-tensioning
system, which enabled us to rejuvenate this 40-year old structure
and extend its overall effective service life.  This paper will
also outline how the new system was installed while the parking
facility remained operational.


A detailed riparian field study to assess the im-portance of
bedrock groundwater in streamflow processes was established in the
headwaters of the Afon Hafren, mid-Wales, UK. Results from this
study identified distinct groundwater horizons close to the stream
channel.  Different flow pathways and travel times resulted in a
different chemical charac-ter of groundwaters in these different
horizons.  Groundwater discharge from these horizons into the
stream was by piston displacement in response to re-charging
rainfall higher up in the catchment.  Groundwater upwelling into
the soils indicated soil water to be sourced from both groundwater
and rain-fall.  Soil waters closest to the stream (ca. 25m) were
predominantly groundwater controlled and may be the major source
for ecologically toxic soil compo-nents such as aluminium entering
the river.
